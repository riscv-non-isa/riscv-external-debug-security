== Zedsec (ISA extension)

This chapter introduces the Zedsec ISA extension, which extends the ISA section of The RISC-V Debug Specification. The RISC-V hart must implement all features to ensure external debug security. It is designed to enforce access control over operations initiated by the Debug Module, as well as constraints on trigger behaviors. Additionally, it incorporates trace functionality, with its output undergoing check based on hart privilege levels.

=== External Debug

By default, the extension forbids the following debug operation in <<dbops>> unless they are explicitly granted to the external debugger.
	
[[dbops]]
.The debug operations affected by Zedsec extension
* Entering Debug Mode                                                     
* Executing Program buffer                                                
* Serving abstract commands (Access Register, Quick Access, Access Memory)

When the debug operations are not granted, all the above operations issued by Debug Module or trigger will be pending or dropped. The subsequent subsections detail how debug operations are granted. 

[[dbgaccpriv]]
==== Debug Access Privilege

The *debug access privilege* is defined as the privilege with which abstract commands or instructions in program buffers access hardware resources such as registers and memory. This privilege operates independently of hart privilege levels and exclusively affects operations within Debug Mode. Memory and register access within Debug Mode are subject to the *debug access privilege*, with all hardware protections, including MMU, PMP, and PMA, checked against it. This privilege is represented by the `prv` and `v` fields in `dcsr`, and it is updated to reflect the hart privilege level upon entering Debug Mode. Each hart has a dedicated *debug access privilege* and it may vary from each other. The permissible privilege levels programmable to `dcsr` in Debug Mode are elaborated in subsequent sections.

In addition, the `mprv` and `mpp` fields take effect exclusively when the *debug access privilege* is in machine mode.

.Determining maximum debug access privilege with mdbgen and sdedbgalw
|=========================================
| mdbgen | sdedbgalw | Maximum debug privilege 
| 1      | x      | M                 
| 0      | 1      | S(HS)             
| 0      | 0      | n/a               
|=========================================

[[mdbgctl]]
==== Machine Mode Debug Control

An input port, named mdbgen[i], is introduced to control the debuggability of machine mode for each hart i. This signal is transmitted to the hart and its corresponding debug access control logic. When mdbgen[i] is set to 1, the debug operations outlined in <<dbops>> are permitted when hart i executes in machine mode. Moreover the following rules apply:

- The <<dbgaccpriv, debug access privilege>> for the hart can be configured to any privilege level 
- If register access without halting the hart is supported, this access carries the privilege of machine mode.

When mdbgen[i] is set to 0, debug operations in machine mode are prohibited for hart i. Any attempt to halt the hart and bring it into Debug Mode will remain pending, and triggers configured to enter Debug Mode will neither fire nor match in machine mode.

[[submdbgctl]]
==== Submachine Mode Debug Control
The submachine mode debug of hart i is determined by the `sdedbgalw` field of CSR <<zedseccsr,msdcfg>> within hart i and mdbgen[i]. Debug operations listed in <<dbops>> are allowed when hart i executes in submachine mode only if the logical-OR of values in sdedbgalw and mdbgen[i] is 1.

The legal value of <<dbgaccpriv, debug access privilege>> for hart i is solely determined by `sdedbgalw` when mdbgen[i] is 0. In the event of `sdedbgalw` being 1 while mdbgen[i] is 0, the debug access privilege can be configured to privilege levels other than machine mode. Any attempt to set debug access privilege to machine mode will result in a security fault error (cmderr 6).

If register access without halting the hart is supported, this access bears the privilege of supervisor/hypervisor mode to access the hart when mdbgen[i] is 0 and `sdedbgalw` is 1.

Debug operations in all modes are prohibited for hart i when the logical-OR of `sdedbgalw` and mdbgen[i] is 0. All halt requests from the Debug Module will remain pending, and triggers configured to enter debug mode will neither match nor fire. The register access without halting is dropped.

.The debuggable privilege levels per debug controls 
|============================================
| mdbgen | sdedbgalw | Debuggable privilege levels 
| 1      | x      | All                      
| 0      | 1      | All except M             
| 0      | 0      | n/a                      
|============================================


=== Trace
The extension requires that trace availability from each hart is constrained by default. When Zedsec is supported, the optional sideband signal to trace encoder, halted, must be implemented for each hart, and this signal must be reset to 1. The halted signal is only cleared when trace is permitted by machine mode trace control or submachine mode trace control.

==== Machine Mode Trace Control 
For each hart i, an input port, mtrcen[i], controls machine mode trace availability. Setting mtrcen[i] to 1 enables machine mode and submachine mode trace by clearing the halted signal to 0 across all privilege levels. Conversely, if mtrcen[i] is set to 0, the halted signal cannot be cleared when the hart operates in machine mode.

==== Submachine Mode Trace Control 
The halted signal for hart i in submachine mode is determined by the `sdetrcalw` field of CSR <<zedseccsr, msdcfg>> within hart i, alongside mtrcen[i]. When the logical-OR of `sdetrcalw` and mtrcen[i] is 1, the halted signal is cleared while the hart runs in submachine mode.

When both `sdetrcalw` and mtrcen[i] are set to 0, the halted signal cannot be cleared at all.

| mtrcen| sdetrcalw| Machine mode | Submachine mode

| 0     | 1     | halted = 1   | halted = 0     
| 0     | 0     | halted = 1   | halted = 1     
|===========================================================

=== Trigger 

The trigger configured to enter Debug Mode is checked by Zedsec extension. The trigger can fire or match in privilege modes outlined in <<dbgpriv>>. 

The extension requires that all pending triggers intending to enter Debug Mode must match or fire before any hart mode switch to prevent privilege escalation.

==== Machine mode accessibility to `dmode` accessibility
 
The RISC-V Debug Specification defines that the `dmode` field is accessible only in Debug Mode. When this field is set, the trigger is allocated exclusively to Debug Mode, and any write access from the hart are disregarded. However, the Debug Mode exclusive trigger could potentially serve as an attack surface for unauthorized submachine mode software where debugging is forbidden. The extension relaxes the constrain to the `dmode`, allowing it to be R/W in machine mode when `mdbgen` is set to 0. When `mdbgen` is set to 0, it remains exclusively accessible within Debug Mode.

[NOTE]
In this definition, machine mode software assumes responsibility for switching the trigger context according to the debug policy enforced for the sub-machine mode. As a result, it maintains a clean trigger context for the sub-machine mode.

==== External triggers

The external trigger outputs follow the same limitations as other triggers, ensuring they do not fire or match when the privilege level of the hart exceeds the ones specified in <<dbgpriv>>.

The sources of external trigger input (such as machine mode performance counter overflow, interrupts, etc.) require protection to prevent information leakage. The external trigger inputs supported are platform-specific. Therefore, the platform is responsible for enforcing limitations on input sources. As a result, tmexttrigger.intctl and tmexttrigger.select should be restricted to legal values based on `mdbgen` and `sdedbgalw`. Their definitions are provided in the <<redtmext>> below.

==== Trigger chain

The privilege level of the trigger chain is determined by the highest privilege level within the chain. The entire trigger chain cannot be modified if the chain privilege level exceeds the <<dbgaccpriv, debug access privilege>>.

[NOTE]
This represents a balance between usability and hardware complexity. The integrity of the trigger chain set by the hart must be maintained when an external debugger intends to utilize triggers. There may be instances where the triggers are linked across different privilege levels (e.g., from supervisor mode to machine mode), while the external debugger may only have access to supervisor mode privilege. The external debugger should not alter the chain, because it could suppress or incorrectly raise breakpoint exceptions in machine mode.


=== Updates of CSR 

==== Sdext CSR

===== Debug Control and Status (dcsr, at 0x7b0)

The hart must not automatically treat an external debugger with machine mode privilege (or surpassing machine mode privilege) without conditions. The `prv` and `v` fields in the dcsr have been enhanced to authorize privilege for debugger accesses. Upon transitioning into Debug Mode, the `prv and `v` fields are updated to reflect the privilege level the hart was previously operating in. The dcsr is always permitted to be accessed in Debug Mode and the fields `prv` and `v` could be configured to grant privilege to the debugger other than the privilege level when the harts transitioned to Debug Mode. The maximum debug privilege level that can be configured in prv and v is determined in <<maxdbgpriv>>. It will generate a security fault error (cmderr 6) if the external debugger attempts to configure `prv` and `v` with a privilege higher than the maximum debug privilege level.

Memory and CSR accesses initiated by abstract commands or from the program buffer will be treated as if they are at the privilege level held in `prv` and `v`. These accesses will undergo protections of PMA, PMP, MMU, and other mechanisms, triggering traps if they violate corresponding rules. 

[NOTE]
The external debugger has the capability to write to prv and v and subsequently read back the value, thus determining the maximum debug privilege level.  

Additionally, the fields in dcsr are further constrained based on their sphere of action. For example, when a field is effective in machine mode, it is accessible only to debugger which is granted with machine mode privilege. The detailed accessibility is listed in the following table.

.Dcsr fields accessibility against privilege granted to external debugger

|============================================

===== Debug PC (dpc, at 0x7b1) and Debug Scratch Register (dscratch0, at 0x7b2; dscratch1, at 0x7b3)

Debug PC (dpc) and Debug Scratch Register (dscratch0, dscratch1) are not restricted by prv and v fields to simplify the architecture.

==== Sdtrig CSR

The extension enforces access control in Debug Mode, which complicates trigger usage within Debug Mode. To mitigate these complications, certain trigger CSRs, tselect, tdata1, tdata2, tdata3, and tinfo are always permitted in Debug Mode, irrespective of the privileges granted to external debuggers. However, the remaining CSRs, tcontrol, scontext, hcontext, mcontext, and mscontext continue to adhere to the debug privileges granted.

[options="header"]
.Trigger CSR accessibility in Debug Mode

| tcontrol(0x7a5)  | Always     | Debug access privilege = M     
| scontext(0x5a8)  | Always     | Debug access privilege >= Sub-M
| hcontext(0x6a8)  | Always     | Debug access privilege >= Sub-M
| mcontext(0x7a8)  | Always     | Debug access privilege = M     
| mscontext(0x7aa) | Always     | Debug access privilege = M     
|================================================================

Beyond CSR-level accessibility adjustments, the fields within mcontrol, mcontrol6, icount, itrigger, etrigger, and tmexttrigger—variants of tdata1 located at 0x7a1—are redefined to limit the effective scope of triggers as follows.

| vu    | M/S/VS/VU                  
|====================================

The textra32, textra64 provides additional filtering capability for triggers. They are permitted for access in Debug Mode, as they do not affect the trigger firing/matching as it is constrained by `mdbgen` and `sdedbgalw`.

The `intctl` and `sselect` field within tmexttrigger are redifined as follows.

[[zedseccsr]]
==== Zedsec CSR

The CSR control knobs in `msdcfg` for submachine mode debug and submachine mode trace are specified in Smsdedbg and Smsdetrc extension respectively in _RISC-V Supervisor Domains Access Protection_ cite:[smmtt]. The Smsdedbg and/or Smsdetrc extension must be implemented to activate security enforcement for debugging and/or tracing.
