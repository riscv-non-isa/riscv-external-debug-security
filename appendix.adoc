== Theory of Operation 

This chapter explains the theory of operation for the External Debug Security Extension. The subsequent diagram illustrates the reference implementation of security control for the debug and trace, respectively.

=== Debug Security Control

As outlined in the specification, the dedicated debug security policy for a hart is enforced by platform state `nsecdbg`, hart state `mdbgen`, and the `sdedbgalw` field inside the `msdcfg` CSR. Both the `nsecdbg` and `mdbgen` states can be accommodated in MMIO outside the harts, such as in the Debug Module registers, or implemented as fuses.  

The security control logic validates all debug requests and triggers (with action=1) firing/matching based on `nsecdbg`, `mdbgen`, and `sdedbgalw` against the privilege level of the hart. Debug requests that fail validation will either be dropped or kept pending. Additionally, the platform-specific external trigger inputs must obey platform constraints, which must be carefully handled by the platform implementation. 

When `nsecdbg` is set to 0, the validation process involves two actors, which may lead to a potential Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue. To mitigate this, the implementation must ensure that both the validation and execution of debug requests occur under the same privilege level and the same debug security policy. Failing to do so may allow debug requests to bypass security controls.

When the external debugger is stepping through an instruction via `dcsr.step` that triggers a transition to a higher privilege level, the security control logic must verify against debug capability according to <<dbgpriv>> before entering Debug Mode. If debugging is permitted, the hart re-enters Debug Mode after executing the instruction. Otherwise, the hart continues executing with the pending single step request until it becomes debuggable and can re-enter Debug Mode. In scenarios where multiple supervisor domains are debuggable, the secure monitor in M-mode may switch the context during single stepping. In such cases, the debugger might stop in a different application than the original one. Users of the debugger should be mindful of this possibility.

Application-level debugging is primarily accomplished through self-hosted debugging, allowing the management of debug policies by supervisor domains. As a result, user-level debugging management is not addressed within this extension.

=== Trace Security Control 

Similar to debug security, trace is controlled by platform state `nsecdbg`, hart state `mtrcen`, and `sdetrcalw` in CSR `msdcfg` for each hart. The sec_inhibit sideband signal indicates the availability of trace to the trace encoder.

== Execution Based Implementation with Sdsec

In an execution-based implementation, the code executing the "park loop" can always run with M-mode privilege to access the memory and CSR. However, once execution is dispatched to an Abstract Command or the program buffer, the privilege level for accessing memory and CSR should be restricted to <<dbgaccpriv, debug access privilege>>. 

To achieve this, a Debug Mode only state element (e.g., a field in a custom CSR) may be introduced to control the privilege level in Debug Mode. When the state is set to 1, Debug Mode allows M-mode privilege; when cleared to 0, it enforces the <<dbgaccpriv, debug access privilege>>. The hardware sets this state to 1 upon entering the park loop and clears it to 0 by the final instruction of the park loop, right before execution is transferred to an Abstract Command or the program buffer.
